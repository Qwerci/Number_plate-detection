# Number_plate-detection

This is a project to detect number plates. It is a long term project where i will occationally improve it and add additional features to it.

##Purpose
What is this project seeking to answer?
That's a good question. I'm just building it for fun but i will probably use it to make other number plate detections.

The model is currently performing badly in this first commit but this will be improved before the next commit.


## Annotation
I downloaded 90 numberplates to build a custom dataset. The platform I used for annotation is makesense.ai. it is good but I couldn't get my the right extension when I used polygon for the annotation. I needed the annotated images in yolo format and only reactangular annotations had that option.
